📌 Project Overview

This project implements a Variational Quantum Classifier (VQC) to predict late delivery risk in a supply chain dataset. The model explores how quantum circuit design and dataset size affect classification performance.

The goal is to experimentally evaluate:

- Effect of dataset size on quantum model accuracy
- Impact of circuit depth (reps)
- Influence of rotation gates (RY vs RY + RZ)
